Installation Instructions (for local development)

1) Do the normal rails gem install dance for any missing dependencies

skom:clusterservice pskomoroch$ rake gems:install 

2) Copy /config/config.yml.example -> /config/config.yml and sub in your own AWS key and secret key

aws_secret_access_key: YYVUYVIUBIBI
aws_access_key_id: BBKBBOUjbkj/BBOUBOBJKBjbjbboubuBUB

Also replace the admin user name and password in that file:

admin_user: REPLACE_ME
admin_password: REPLACE_ME

This application should be run under SSL and the access should be restricted to 
only trusted application ip addresses using EC2 security group filters.  Ideally, your
Client application is also running on EC2 in the same security group.

3) Create the database

skom:clusterservice pskomoroch$ rake db:create
skom:clusterservice pskomoroch$ rake db:migrate

4) Launch the rails app itself 

skom:clusterservice pskomoroch$ script/server 
=> Booting Mongrel
=> Rails 2.3.2 application starting on http://0.0.0.0:3000
=> Call with -d to detach
=> Ctrl-C to shutdown server

5) Launch a background delayed_job worker

skom:clusterservice pskomoroch$ rake jobs:work
(in /Users/pskomoroch/rails_projects/elasticwulf-service/clusterservice)
*** Starting job worker host:72-63-103-214.pools.spcsdns.net pid:12221
background cluster launch initiated...
